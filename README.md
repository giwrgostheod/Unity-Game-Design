# Unity_Game_Design
-------------------

In this project we have implemented a game in Unity platform. The game is called Tower Crush:

Theme / Setting / Genre:
------------------------
    - <There are four Towers on a Plane – two Red and two Green –
    ready for destruction with the use of two player mods of different
    colors (red and green) >
    
Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief:
------------------------------
    - <A* algorithm was chosen for finding the closest path to our
    target and avoiding the Cylinder obstacle in the center of the Plain>
    - <Destruction of the spheres and the Towers on collision>
    - <The spheres are created only in even coordinates (x,y) of the
    Plain >
    - <The player can choose the color of the spheres – red or
    green>
    - <The player can create three different types of spheres. Each
    sphere has its own behavior : the reds go to the closest Red Tower
    and the greens go to the closest green Tower(with the right mouse
    button) and when you hit the left mouse button the sphere of your
    chosen color goes to the nearest Tower(independently of the color) >
    - <Each Tower is destroyed when 10 spheres hit it.>
    - <The player can create only 40 spheres of each color with the
    right click. >
    - <The player can create only 20 spheres of each color with the
    left click. >
    - <The game ends with the destruction of all four Towers.>
    
Targeted platforms:
-------------------
    - <PC>
    - <Smartphones>
